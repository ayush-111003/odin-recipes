    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made with layers of pasta, cheese, sauce, and often meat or vegetables. To prepare it, start by making a rich meat sauce. Heat olive oil in a large pan, sauté finely chopped onions and garlic until soft, then add ground beef or Italian sausage, cooking until browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried herbs like oregano and basil, and season with salt and pepper. Let the sauce simmer for about 30 minutes to develop flavor. Meanwhile, cook lasagna noodles according to the package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside.

        Next, assemble the lasagna. In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a layer of ricotta cheese mixed with beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, and chopped parsley. Add a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese, then repeat the layers until the dish is full, finishing with a top layer of meat sauce and mozzarella. Bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for about 30-40 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden. Let it rest for 10 minutes before serving to allow the layers to set. Enjoy your homemade lasagna!</p>
